## Form I-485

### Part 1
(22) There is no nonimmigrant Visa on this Passport (B6958137) , the Visa is attached to the older Passport (a7747460). Should we say specifically that this is attached to the older Passport (A7747360) instead of the new Passport (B6958137)?

### Part 2
(6b) Should be PRESENT instead of empty?
