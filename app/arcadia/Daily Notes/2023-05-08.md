Pinecone querying example list of ids:

Turns out the id of each vector is uuid

What did I learn about AutoGPT?
The structure: Context -> Thinking -> User approval (if necessary) -> Actions -> Context

Isn't the goal specific docsGPT more similar to autogpt than chatpdf?

Goal of docsGPT:
- search for "how to be buff": consume the information from the internet all at once.
- Consultant: hire from big company, it has problem: profit loss; AI ask you for financial reports, analyzes docs, internet search. AI generate the action items

HBR Use cases. Find the solution for your problem based on HBR database (relevant past data)

2 concerns about the generous free plan. 
1. *She thinks the plan is not well thought off*. 
2. The emailing to the existing users. 

**(1)**
The expectation of the generous free plan:
1. Increase in volume can accomodate in the decrease of the conversion rate

However, it seems like the plan isn't well thought off. Why?
1. There's no concrete plan to increase the volume. Assumptions:
	1. Our users don't use our free products for serious things:
		1. Web pages -> most people uses their own domain when publishing
		2. Forms -> we can't compare features with Tally.
		3. Blog -> why not use ghost/substack/medium?

Are we banking on the watermark of the free plan? If so, what are the statistics on the watermark conversion?

**(2)**
Why are we emailing to existing pro users that we have a free plan that includes 100 CMS and 100 form submissions?
