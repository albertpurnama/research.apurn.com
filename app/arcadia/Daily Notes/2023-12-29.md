*What's on my mind today?*

- Figure out the NodeScene generated when you're making Figma content.
- [ ] Create all text style permutations in the project. 
  - Make sure there are no duplicates.
- [ ] Generate mapping from old text style to new text styles
- [ ] Create function, given a figma node, what is the new text style id?

I learned that there are levels of understanding in any subject. For engineering specifically, you can follow getting started tutorial and build an entire reddit app from start to finish using react with almost 0 software engineering knowledge.

However, this doesn’t mean that you understand what you have made. Why is understanding what you’ve made important? Because if you don’t understand what each line of code does, how can you create anything other than the getting started guide (reddit)?

What’s something similar in marketing? What levels of knowledge are there in marketing?

In engineering, the knowledge depth can be categorized as follows from shallow to deepest:
1. Follow tutorials
2. Recognize common patterns
3. Understand why common patterns are chosen (programming paradigms)
