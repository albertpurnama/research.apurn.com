## 🪵 Log
*What's on my mind today?*


**Opening:**

"Hi [Employee's Name], thank you for meeting with me today. I have some difficult news to share."

**Reason for Layoff:**

"As you know, our company was recently acquired by [Acquiring Company]. As part of the acquisition, there have been strategic reviews of all departments, and unfortunately, this has resulted in some restructuring."

**Impact:**

"Regrettably, this restructuring means that your position is being eliminated. This decision is in no way a reflection of your performance or contributions, which have been greatly valued."

**Next Steps:**

"We are offering you a severance package, which includes 2 months of severance pay."

**Support:**

"We want to support you through this transition, so we are providing [outplacement services, resume assistance, career counseling, etc.]. Please know that we are here to help you in any way we can during this time."

**Closing:**

"I understand this is a lot to take in, and I’m available to discuss any questions or concerns you might have. I want to thank you for all your hard work and dedication to the company. This decision was incredibly tough, and I wish it wasn’t necessary. Again, thank you for everything."
