## 🪵 Log
*What's on my mind today?*


beehiiv standup:
- Working on search v2, cumulatively we implemented around 100 settings, shout out to Safa, Putri, Said and last but not least claude code.
- Helping the car dealership with issue on email capture popup
- Continuing QA + resolving feedback on the search v2.

Mike 1:1/1 on 1:
- Advanced keyword search. 
	- I think its abstraction is very strong.
	- We can implement literally the same thing for the left side panel which is great I think.
	- Safa comes in sort of playing the devil's advocate which makes it somewhat battle-tested.
- Management
	- You've been a "manager" for a lil over a year or maybe more, you're managing a team of 5+ people maybe 10+. What are sort of your learnings/"battle scars"
	- What are the main things that you focus on as managerial part of things?
