- [x] Review Ridho's PR on search blog item ⏳ 2023-06-20 📅 2023-06-20 ✅ 2023-07-10
- [ ] 


I think teaching the interns helped me realize something about my impostor’s syndrome. You feel like there are people who are years behind you in terms of engineering knowledge.

Wow
So today I did a couple of interesting things.
The first one is a did a walk with tony and putri like we also went to Popeyes together. Talked about marketing content call contents value is very important for increasing the views of the account.
Second interesting thing today is I went to a local bar to play some booty games which is pretty fun and looking forward for next session which like I think it’s every week on Tuesdays so I am might have to move Ridho’s 1 on 1 from Tuesday to Wednesday or just fitting in to Monday

I am I also need to do an edit on the template for the daily notes on obsidian just to make sure I have this kind of audio journal entry on another section which is separate from the daily to do or logs

It is also interesting to probably add a summarization part where it’s sort of understands the mood of the particular day, and like off the log it in the in the mood part just from the sentences that I record right now.




Hey guys sorry I can’t join the standup today. My updates:
- Made a PR for @typedream/data transpile module
- Made progress for admin side for the form templates (it can render forms properly from customization prop)

Next:
- Duplicate the form collection on template usage in editor. (Then update the form content)
