*What's on my mind today?*


Hey YC. I encouraged my friend Gary to apply because I think you guys would love to have a founder like him. We got to know each other when he ran his first startup. He has an insatiable curiosity and is a fast learner. He's focused on finding real world problems and create good solutions to it.

Murial is what he is working right now, it’s a memorial website platform. The testimonials and user love he’s getting is very strong and very touching. 

He is applying as a solo founder but I have faith he’ll make it. Hope it’s a great fit!
