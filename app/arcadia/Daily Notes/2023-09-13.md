Feedback list on Bodhi:
- Make a project, try to create some software that you have no idea how to make,, but really interested in making.
	- Need to learn the basics by doing them (git), understand patterns.
	- You need to learn outside of work scope. Try to read/follow more tutorials, do stuff!
- Professional side:
	- Everything's good, I'm not complaining.

I don't think it's good to have a long-running internship role tho. I personally question people who have interned at a company for more than 6 months at a time. I think here's what we should do, I think we should end the internship at 3 months, but you can come back later during the winter holiday or smth.

In the meantime, your "internship" will be a 6months project that you're going to make, maybe make some software that you really want, make a simple game or smth that you want.
