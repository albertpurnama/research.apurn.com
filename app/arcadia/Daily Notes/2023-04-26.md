## 🪵 Log
*What's on my mind today?*


## Cycle 4 planning
Cycle 3 not done:
- DreamEditor
	- Why? backward compatibility issue with Navbar.
	- Navbar still needs UI polish (on smaller screens).
	- CMS is kinda done, still need some improvements that can be done later.

The miscommunication on Ibe's tasks not done:
1. Because I told Ibe to focus on Navbar, he didn't specifically told me that he probably can't finish his task
2. Suggestion: tell Putri sooner (end of week 1).


Tested v0.62.0
