Hi there!

I'm trying to make the webhook MERCHANT.ONBOARDING.COMPLETED to fire after the completion of the onboarding using the "Onboarding Before Payment" partner referral URL.

Here's one example of the link:

https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/bizsignup/partner/entry?referralToken=Nzk3NjMyM2EtYWFkOC00ZDFkLWJiZDMtOTEwZTc4MjRkOWE1WjFUSkRhRUdsMGpwNEdNREFWZDZ3OStiQituQ2g3eURrZ1FPcXVNbzRMcz12Mg==

The client ID of the sandbox app platform is AZ5hdQz-0EV9l73R7jyvZ4hCPLqmhyKeE-XylXJPeaveEhbKGZY9ddLuM_iB0MFFrSkFQmuOO0phHbuY

The webhook id is 56U59958C5923680H

I am trying to make sure that the merchants that is onboarded to our platform is recorded through the webhook using the guide from https://developer.paypal.com/docs/multiparty/seller-onboarding/before-payment/

However, MERCHANT.ONBOARDING.COMPLETED does not fire even after I followed the guide. It is also reflected in the webhook logs that there is no webhook event created.

How can I solve this or what information do you need from me to solve this?




Hi there!  
  
I'm trying to figure out why our Stripe Connect onboarding process does not allow our users to choose India as its business location.  
  
It's saying that "We cannot change the country of this account from US to IN. Please reach out to support for help creating a new account."  
  
We have created a test stripe account albert+india@typedream.com that I specifically selected to have Indian location.  
  
Even with that Indian test account, the Stripe Connect onboarding does not allow business location of India to be selected.  
  
Please help!


But I did set the country to IN in the beginning for albert+india@typedream.com and it still doesn't allow me to select India as business location on the Stripe Connect onboarding process
