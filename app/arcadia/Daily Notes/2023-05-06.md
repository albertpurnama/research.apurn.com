James' PR: Build off this PR if you're collaborating on this re-arch!
https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3717

**Re-arch status 05-05-2023 (20h GMT)**

**Workspace** 
- PR for review here: https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3795/files
merged and good enough for now IMO

**Commands**
- https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3824
Has a hard untangling from global state problem to solve and a hard make it more easily pluginable problem

**Settings & Config**
- Merged: https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3805
merged and good enough for now IMO

**Language model**
- PR for the language model abstraction: https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3850/files
open for review, but in good shape

**Logging**
- Draft PR here https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3853
in good shape but needs a little work

**Message Broker**
- Reviewed. this can use some more discussion, but comes after we handle the other abstractions.
- https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3831/files 
Usage is fuzzy so the interface is fuzzy.  May merge and address later when we have a clearer idea of when/what the agent communicates

**Planning/ Prompt engineering**
- Merged https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3790/files
 in good shape, some revisions in language model PR to make interfaces work together

**Budget**
- To do
Todo, will be very straightforward

**Memory**
- Todo
waiting a bit on pwuts to see where his work lands, but will move forward shortly

**Plugins**
- Todo
is hard
