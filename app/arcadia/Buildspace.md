We build it for them, then they use it.

Onboarding vs real life meeting
- Onboarding is for getting feedback.

Should we do this more often?
- Did they say it's cool because we're there. **Are they paying?**
	- Case: Kai previously got onboarded, she doesn't want to pay. She already made in glideapps. She's not there yet.



- Didn't do anything too different from Putri
