Last month:
- OKR implemented on 1st
	- Decision maker for every department
- Changes in the department for some people
	- Putri -> product
	- Kevin -> growth handles QA 1:1
	- Anthony -> finance, helpdesk
- Product alignment with the whole team


Findings:
- Churn (As of April 4th):
	- Expensive
	- There are alternatives


Cycle 3:
- Ridho kayaknya kebanyakan.

Tracking for each project:
1. Need to have a list of mixpanel events to be implemented
2. Then, ask the project lead for estimation on when (1) will start to be tracked.

Mixpanel on Reynaldo:
1. Need to research how to track the people who didn't even publish.

**Time to value needs to be very short**.

Tony:
- No more backend OKR
- Start making infra documentation (more visibility)
- Finance stuff hired fondo for it, but still a lot of stuff to do:
	- Some fucky things that we did (some amount of dollars not transferred to indo)


## Albert
What went well
- More focus on bug fixing/general improvements.
- Tracking metrics.
- Comms getting better.

What went hell
- The churn metrics aren't recorded properly for the whole month.
	- Notion >< Linear linked, if there's no linear issue in notion, you ask the lead.
- Telling QA/CS team to report bugs labelled as "user reported"
	- CS team didn't know that yet.
	- Communicate better, announcement.
- Infra incident, its not clear who's responsible.
	- I should be the one telling Tony who made the incident report.

Suggestions
- Try to address a couple of "what went hell"s in this retro meeting


## Kevin
What went well
- Visibility better because of the metrics

What went hell
- Tracking isn't as simple as we thought, for example: churn wasn't recorded for a 3 weeks
	- Churn: fixed, the main problem is forgetting to turn it off.
		- Next time, subscribe to the linear issue, ask for the linear issue if it doesn't exist yet.
		- Project Owner -> update the project status every week if the project is worked on by more than 1 person.
	- Conversion: mainly driven by custom domain, for other feature there's no tracking.
		- Tried to do Mixpanel stuff, asked Rey to review implementation details.
- 

Suggestions
- none for now


## Michelle
What went well
- Having OKR is ok, more accountable, focused on everyday work.
- Communication getting better, comms between Putri and Kevin

What went hell
- Was not able to meet checkpoint to reach OKR
	- 1 user success stories per week not met
	- CS: not able to monitor mimis as much as I want

Suggestions
- Work together same place, same time? Work schedule improvement

## Putri
What went well
- Quite on track on the OKR, specifically for dumpl.ink v2 and Typedream
	- Typedream workspace
- Cycle 3 tasks is a bit more aligned, not all over the place.

What went hell
- Hard time PM-ing the thing, orchestrating the project management.
	- Onboarding flow mau ditambahin link in bio.
	- There are flows that sort of complicated, need to fix it.
- Product quality on CS and QA, cannot do this, too many things.
	- For now, maybe can only ask periodically whether there's any urgent quality issue that needs to be addressed.
- Haven't seen the marketing plan.
	- mixpanel (tracking)
	- public template (workspace)
	- double sided incentive (rewardful)
		- Supposed to increase revenue, but there should be a frontend side.
	- stripe data export (churn)

Suggestions
- None yet

## Anthony
What went well
- Nothing that hasn't been said

What went hell
- Not consistent on a weekly basis.
	- Sometimes do infra stuff, sometimes do finance, backend, improvements on typedream.com/ documentation.
	- Change the OKR phrasing
- So far, no time yet to do help desk.

Suggestions
- none atm.
