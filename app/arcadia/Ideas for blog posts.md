###### The irony of efficiency

Hi nerds! I haven't been putting out more blog content for the past couple of months now. I figured I might share something about my self-improvement journey. 

Over the past couple of years, I have tried to:
- Sleeping better
- Personal OKRs,
- Meditate,
	- Meditation strategies that I've implemented
- Schedule: tried strict schedules, and flexible schedules.
	- Share learnings about your own scheduling.
- Sharpening my knowledge: dedicate a few hours every week to reading out better practices, opinions about existing code strategies, data modeling, designs, and anything that I frequently encounter in work/life.

After doing this for a couple of years, I still feel like I'm not getting enough done by each day.  That feeling never goes away. In other words, all the personal improvement that I've tried to do doesn't actually solve the problem.

Looking back, I'm probably 10x more than I was 3 years ago, and my effort in self-improving myself is working great. But from the book *Four Thousand Weeks* by Oliver Burkeman, I learned that the more efficient you become, the more things will be thrown at you. The tasks that you need to do increases the more efficient you become. This is what Oliver called the efficiency trap.

So what's the solution? Should I stop improving myself and let myself just be... slow? Oliver's solution was along the lines of accepting that we humans are limited, we will die, we have things we want to do and we have to accept that we will never get everything done.

Burkeman's message is that we should embrace the present moment and focus on what truly matters, rather than trying to cram more into our limited time on earth. By doing so, we can find greater joy and fulfillment in our lives, even as we acknowledge the irony of our mortality.

I think it's the bitter truth about human life, we'll never get everything done. We are mortals after all. Unless Dr. Sinclair pulls off the reverse aging for the general population

SEO and performance, why bad lighthouse performance does not always mean bad performance and SEO?

###### Token Gate: The Why

- Not a novel idea. The whole idea of token gating is to increase the utility of any token (erc20, erc 721, etc).
	- What do I mean by utility of the token?
	- How Token gate increase utility?
		- Through value locked behind the gate.
			- can be courses, or gated communities
- The market condition at the moment?
	- Crypto-market is starting to stabilize.
	- Opportunities dried up (not a lot of volume in trades) or NFT activities.
	- Builders build, heads down until the next bull run.
- Conclusion
	- Token Gating is one way to increase any token's fundamental value.


In 2021 and early 2022 we have seen both the rise and fall of NFTs. We can see the adoption of NFTs as some sort of asset to be traded and make profit. The demand for NFTs increases the prices of these NFTs. However, the increase in price of each individual NFTs does not mean that the underlying value of NFTs increase. On the surface, it might look that some NFTs are becoming more and more valuable over time since its price increases over time. Unfortunately, this was not the case.

Since NFT's price inflation rate is not proportional to its value, NFT creators are trying to find ways to increase the value of the NFT itself. One of many ways to increase NFT's value is through its community. Essentially "gating" its community with the ownership of the token.

How community gates work

- Community manager creates/modify existing Discord server to use collab.land to protect community access.
- Community manager creates NFTs with some base price of let's say 0.1 Eth to mint (purchase).
- After a user mints the NFT, the user can then access the community's Discord Server.

###### Token Gating: The How

- From the previous blog we discussed...
	- Add quotes from previous blog.. etc.
- What is token gate, technically?
	- Authentication & Authorization system.
		- The distinction between them is important
- Authentication
	- Is essentially the part where we check if the user actually met the condition to be considered an "authenticated" user.
		- The condition might be
			- The ownership of an NFT
			- The ownership of x amount of ERC20 token.
- Authorization
	- JWT verification that is generated after the Authentication process.
