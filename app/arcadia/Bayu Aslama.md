Udah jelas belum dari sisi product?
- In general, udah.
- Perlu di improve:
	- Beberapa design, agak kurang clear: scroll behavior kurang jelas.
- 

Saran/Suggestion:
- Jawab" zendesk still very difficult, can we make help desk/docs around it?
- 

This cycle (5) bakal beres.



#### May 14th, 2023

Feedback for me:
- Overall: udah ok dengan cara manage, 
	- Kemaren sempet performance turun, but di push dengan ok. Nggak cuek terhadap performance.
	- Berani buat sampein apa adanya. Honesty
	- Kalo lagi OK, performance diappreciate.
- Perlu di improve:
	- Review lebih cepet?
		- Pelan" delegasi review.
	- Kadang" lupa yang udah disampein:
		- Beberapa kali suka lupa kalo mau ngomongin X, tapi lupa lakuin X
		-

### February 6th 2023

Lumayan ngebut daripada sebelum"nya.

1.  What do you think is the correct approach to reporting engineering progress
	1. Ketika dapet task, present apa yang ditangkep dan apa yang bakal dilakuin. Present dengan clear apa yang harus dilakuin. Masih banyak asumsi yang tidak ditanyakan kemaren. Mungkin harus spend 1-2 hari untuk break down the task.
	2. Use linear more(?) or...
	3. At the end of today, hari ini udah ngapain aja.
2.  What do you think went well (and hell) with moving CMS over to dream-editor
	1. Went Hell:
		1. Too many assumptions, no questions asked.
		2. Code needs to be reworked.
	2. Went well:
		1. Know the pattern more.
3.  Suggestions on what stuff to do (or hack) together (the whole engineering team).
	1. Replicate wordpress's plugin, create new block types.
		1. Doesn't know yet what plugin to be made. Many of our customers are from Wordpess.
	2. Watch netflix together(?).
	3. Games.

**The wifey**
Masih ada obat, nunggu lab report.
Tunggu mesti ada lab work lagi atau pindah spesialis lain.

#### January 30th 2023

- Tangan suka geter
- Thyroid
- Terkait psikologi.

Seharusnya bisa dikejer dalam waktu dekat.

#### January 23rd 2023

- Context masih perlu banyak dipindahin.
- Belom bisa selesai early this week.

**What do you think of your performance so far?**
- 6/10 - Slow down in CMS editor

Dari linear project mungkin ada beberapa tasks, di review dulu bisa gak?


#### January 15th 2023
- Makin confident in moving the CMS editor.
- Already can see the patterns.

**What's the difference between the last 2 weeks and the last 2 months**
- More exploring the code, trying to understand the code.
- From answering support.

- A bit surprised by the AI things, everything happens so fast.
- Skip AI for now.

**What can we improve for the past couple of weeks?**
- from SlateJSON to react native?
	- a Typedream website can be a react native app.

**Timeline on DreamEditor?**
- 4 weeks possible, 2 weeks-ish some need improvement.

#### Feedback Queue
- (-) I specifically said some stuff should exist in the app layer and not in `dream-editor` layer, but it seems like he's not listening. https://github.com/typedreamhq/cloud/pull/1107. I even put it in the description https://linear.app/typedream/issue/TD-2871/replicate-editor-on-collection-page-using-dream-editor

#### Perf Review January 8th, 2023


**Your own self-assessment. Rate yourself from 1-10 overall, which aspect you think you're still lacking, which parts are your strong points.**

Rated himself 5, Why?
- Self testing? mungkin ada tugas" kecil yang belum.
- How about the quality of the product? 6/10, lacking in terms of performance, logic, etc. Think too much, very complex solution.
- How about the speed? Beberapa hari/pekan terakhir 4-5/10.

 **Your assessment on the current project & timeline**
 - The project itself can be done in 6 weeks he agrees.
 - Belom ada plan week 1...n deliverables.


#### Perf Review January 1st 2023

**Feedback for me:**
- Likes leadership.
- Negative feedback none


**How does Bayu learn best?**
Documentation. There are some parts that are incomplete.
- `getStaticProps` documentation:
	- What kind of documentation?
	- Per section, explain what it does.
- Documentation on running dev server.

Need improvement:
- Should know that there's missing requirements, in the case of attribute id, it's missing the state where it shows all the attribute values that are set.
- ![[Pasted image 20221228165548.png]] 
- The above is taken from https://github.com/typedreamhq/cloud/pull/1079. shows another hacky solution. 2nd strike
- 

Thoughts:
https://github.com/typedreamhq/cloud/pull/1010

- question: "z-index, Penting atau gak?"
- Check specific case
- How much score you gave:
	- 2-3/10

---------

#### Perf Review December 4, 2022

Good:
- Quick response in customer support.
- Good initiatives:
	- https://typedreamhq.slack.com/archives/D047TUW9DU4/p1669413944143979

Need to work on:
- Need to understand more react fundamentals https://github.com/typedreamhq/cloud/pull/939
- Sloppy PR https://github.com/typedreamhq/cloud/pull/947 Need to be a bit more careful or maybe need a bit more time to adjust.
- Sloppy solution https://github.com/typedreamhq/cloud/pull/990. same case as 947 where he has no deep understanding of why things don't work the way he expects.


#### Feedback December 4, 2022

Things that went well:
- Communication very good
- Per-week task assignment, not too much but not too little

Things that went hell:
- Connection issue when calling.

You think did well:
- More confidence in working on bugs and features.
- Assigned forms, running the api server increases confidence

You think did hell:
- Wrong answers on slack support chat
- Slowing down because of the Internet.
