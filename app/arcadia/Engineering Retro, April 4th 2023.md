Based on [[Engineering Retro, Feb 14 2023]]:

- Happy hour on the weekend.
- Earlier planning meeting.
- Reviewing faster:
	- Review the functionality first from preview link, then the code smell.
- Tim product/design yang click", jangan engineer.
	- Functionality perspective engineer sample OK dulu, baru sampe design.
- Development di mac kena heap alloc.
- Need and want to make docs:
	- Available API doc, Component Doc. What are the components? and how does each of the component work?
	- Lebih ke arah what components are available?
- The session for new parts of the app. how to use it etc.

#### Bayu

What went well:
- Collection Settings discussion went well

What went to hell:
- Performance not going better, need to improve performance?
- Communication, have some incorrect assumptions
- Didn't plan well for the leave.

Suggestion for next cycle:
- Timing/Planning di awal, stick sama plan nya.

#### Putri

What went to hell:
- Changed the plan midway, changed a lot of stuff midway
- Missed a lot of reviews, especially from Ridho.
- Wasn't very clear when working with Resi on the design >< code spec.
- Steve's project: there are a couple of unmet requirements.
- Past 2 cycles have been overviewing projects:
	- Missed a lot of stuff because can't go too detailed.

What went well:
- Dumplink stuff doing pretty well, and on track.
- Mostly working with Ridho, cutting up the task with the template, pecah"in the template went pretty well.

Suggestion:
- Timing/planning early on.
- Changed 6 weeks cycle to 2 weeks cycle
	- Make sure the stuff that's gonna be done is very clear and can be released in 2 weeks.

#### Ridho

What went well:
- Breaking tasks into smaller chunks.

What went hell:
- Review this cycle takes too much time.
	- Peer reviewed in the editor.

Suggestion:
- Figure out how to improve our bonding in the team.

#### Ibe

What went hell:
- Navbar project went hell.
	- miscalculated a big part of it, specifically on the dropdown part.

What went well:
- Discussions with Albert and Ridho lumayan membantu, kadang dapet inspirasi baru, ada perspektif baru untuk selesaiin task

Suggestion:
- Better planning process.

#### Kemad

What went hell:
- Investigating bugs and tickets very hard because have to learn the codebase first, it's very hard to understand

What went well:
- Getting to know everyone is going well.
- Learning codebase is very fast through:
	- Asking peers
	- Fixing bugs

Suggestion:
- Better planning better through a couple of meetings.
	- Backlog grooming
	- Cycle planning


#### Resi

What went to hell:
- Design in Dumplink was never meant to be exact
	- Gives out a lot of time to figure out the CSS

What went well:
- Adapted pretty well with the existing workflow, linear and other tools that we use (notion).
- Support rotation helps understand the product more.

Suggestion:
- Try to utilize more of the linear feature. Cycle feature correctly.
- Make the notion more active.
