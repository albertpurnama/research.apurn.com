# Technical
- Deploy

>From your take home project, you were tasked to make some custom components using SlateJS. Can you go through your code and tell us briefly what each part of your component do?

- Started explaining all the files.
- Explaning how image upload works with Slate:
	- Browser convert file to URL
	- Explain this.state.value.change().call(insertImage, objectUrl)
	- Go to onChange ???


>If you have used any text editing applications, you must've used undo or redo feature. We have the same feature in SlateJS. We know that you are not familiar with this feature in SlateJS yet, but can you spend about 10 to 15 minutes trying to find out how undo or redo feature work in Slate?

- Immediately find Slate History
- Played around with code sandbox example
	- Added redo.
- Need some hints to go to the code, not going to code yet.
- Needed a lot of guidance to find the specific code.
- Seems like cannot link editor.undo() with e.undo() from withHistory plugin?
- Try to explain what reverse() does............ and failed....
- Push and pop need to google.
