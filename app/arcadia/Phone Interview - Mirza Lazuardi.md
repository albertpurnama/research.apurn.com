>From your take home project, you were tasked to make some custom components using SlateJS. Can you go through your code and tell us briefly what each part of your component do?

interface as function????
Text node highlight? 
understood what the element types are for
leaf vs element? says leaf is the children. Root level is considered elements.

useMemo save state from the editor? GG

React State vs Props
very good!

>If you have used any text editing applications, you must've used undo or redo feature. We have the same feature in SlateJS. We know that you are not familiar with this feature in SlateJS yet, but can you spend about 10 to 15 minutes trying to find out how undo or redo feature work in Slate?

went to slateJS, got to `withHistory`
Got into the code itself
Looking at `HistoryEditor` 
Very quiet.


explained starting from `withHistory` function.
undo and redo happening there??????
never actually got into `withHistory`'s implementation. Only its definition file?!?!
