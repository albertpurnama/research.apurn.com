- Support was difficult to get right because QAs answer those tickets **individually**. Lack of communication, coordination
- Sometimes miss the customer support ticket
- Not enough QA documentation for issues that are found, need google sheets before putting it to Linear
- Many duplicate issues.

Improvements that have been made:
- Better communication through gathering the QA in the meeting.
- More meetings

Monday - Wednesday -> regression test on prod
Thursday - Friday -> regression test on editor-git-main
