What I want:
1. Everytime I encounter something I'm stuck at, I can jump on a call to do pair programming with you to resolve the issue on my setup
2. Work on some parts of the app, in a single repository that we can both collaborate on.

Action items:
1. Setup the unity repository
2.

Update:
1. Make things light mode by default

Weird things:
1. After 5 minutes of playing around with it.
2. “Asterisk asterisk” to indicate bold LOL
