Purpose is to figure out a system for making estimation more accurate.

Based on current system, there are a couple of weaknesses:
1. Can't really estimate well, 2 rework project from 6 weeks -> 12 weeks. Workspace project from 6 weeks -> 12 weeks.
2. Need constant monitoring of progress, engineers didn't really say that the project deadline need to be extended.
3. QA does not know exactly how a product should behave. Often asks the question "should it behave this way?".


Went well:
1. Low fidelity documentation that requires less effort from product team, more towards engineering to figure things out

## Current system

From product team figure out:
1. What to be built, and why. Make a documentation for it (in notion)
2. Communicate with design team whether the design is implementable.
3. Estimate the appetite for the project.

Design team produces:
1. Wireframes from product team
2. High fidelity design doc in figma

Engineering:
1. Figure out how to implement the design.
2. Go back and forth between design if there's some missing components.


## Next system

We need better product spec because:
- Product development estimation can be better if we define the project better early on.
- QA can know exactly what to look for in testing the features.




### Product specification
Questions: does product spec documentation have references to code?
1.  Introduction – defines the purpose, intended audience, and intended use.
2.  General description – describes how the product works and users’ needs.
3.  Requirements – explains the functional, non-functional, and system requirements.

Here are some basic rules that work well for most software projects²:
1. Define the purpose of your product.
2. Identify your target audience.
3. Describe your product's features and functionality.
4. Define your product's scope.
5. Identify any technical requirements or constraints.
6. Define your product's user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).
7. Identify any third-party integrations or dependencies.

Here is an example of a software requirement specification document for a startup MVP²:
1. Introduction
    - Purpose
    - Scope
    - Definitions
    - References
2. General Description
    - Product Perspective
    - Product Functions
    - User Characteristics
    - Constraints
3. Specific Requirements
    - External Interface Requirements
    - Functional Requirements
    - Performance Requirements
    - Design Constraints
    - Software System Attributes
