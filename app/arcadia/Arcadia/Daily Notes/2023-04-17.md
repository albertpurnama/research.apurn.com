**Here are some tips to help you improve your ability to think fast during discussion meetings:**
1. Prepare meeting materials in advance: this includes the goal of the meeting.
2.  Listen actively: Try to understand the other person first, notice some underlying issues (if any).
3.  Take notes: This will help you focus and stay on topic
4.  Ask clarifying questions: if something's unclear, ask for clarification!
5.  Practice thinking on your feet: One of the best ways to improve your ability to think on your feet is to practice. Consider participating in improv classes or other activities that require you to think quickly and creatively.
6. Focus on the outcome: In every meeting, there are goals that needs to be achieved. Prioritize getting to those goals instead of going around the topics.
7.  Reflect after the meeting: Time for reflection, what went well, what went hell, what can be improved in next meeting.

#### Motivation
It triggers me when i see bella's new boyfriend Instagram. It motivates me to workout, improve myself. How can I summon this motivation at will? Furthermore, how can I maintain the level of motivation?
