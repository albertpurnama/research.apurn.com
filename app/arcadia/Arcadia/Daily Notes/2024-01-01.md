## 🪵 Log
*What's on my mind today?*

I am feeling angry after talk about splitting up. 

**Why?**
I feel that personally, my personal growth has been stagnant. 

Everything that I’ve done so far has majority been to clean up mistakes, build products that doesn’t help me grow in my technical skill. *Not true, you’ve been pushing out new features like email marketing, ai stuff, etc.*

Am I angry because anthony has the exact opposite values compared to mine, but why does it work for him? Is my belief wrong?

Am I angry because I wanted to be Bill Gates, but couldn’t? Am I just projecting my anger to another person because of my own limitation?

Is making startup after marriage really that bad? Maybe you shouldn’t be fixated on what age you started or ended the startup career.

Create python endpoint that does:

1. Given a screenshot, output the info on the icon, which icon is it? give url


Game plan:
1. Screenshot a couple of icons from Phosphor Icons.
2. Store it somewhere in the database, maybe vector database generate image embedding?
3. Create endpoint to search the image in the database.
	1. Vector search, cosine similarities
