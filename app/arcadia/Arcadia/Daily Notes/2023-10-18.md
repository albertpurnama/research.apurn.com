*What's on my mind today?*

Hi there, 

I'm currently working to implement an affiliate system on top of my platform that uses Stripe Connect to enable our Sellers to accept payments from their Buyers on our Platform.

We are currently using Direct Charge https://stripe.com/docs/connect/direct-charges to charge the buyers. We are trying to add additional fees on top of the application fee for our referrals. So let's say the commission of the referral sale is 10%, and platform fee is 10%, the charge breakdown for a $100 sale would be $10 to our platform, $10 to affiliate's connected account, $80 to seller's connected account (excluding all stripe fees).

I do not see a clear way to do this kind of transaction on Stripe's Direct Charge system. Is there a documentation that I can refer to?
