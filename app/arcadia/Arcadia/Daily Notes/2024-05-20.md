*What's on my mind today?*


Questions for Langfuse:
1. I'm new to the whole compliance of PII, I'm storing sensitive information but I don't really know what is it that I need, here's what I'm storing and processing:
	1. Passport information
	2. SSN number
	3. Legal name, past legal names
	4. Potentially financial information
	In what framework or general direction should I think about securing this information whenever I work with LLMs? Do I need to host my own model? use OSS? Would love to learn from your experience
2. Who did you talk to when you're figuring out these security issues?
3. Any questions for me?


1. ans: AWS store data, for example, degrees of data (What would I feel like I most angry about? Confidential information.) GDPR. 
2. Get the list of services that touch user data, minimize it. 
3. Privacy policy, data protection agreement
	1. PP -> hey user, this is how we use your data, here's how we store it, document very transparently, etc.
	2. Go down the list, is everything SOC compliant?
4. Learning by doing, data protection consultant in Germany. Maybe post on Bookface, Grata/Vanta for compliance certification.
