I saw a couple of good pickup lines on this.

As a context: the anime girl is called Zero Two. She loves the main character named “Hiro”

I saw some pickup lines on reddit, something like “your smile makes me fo from zero two hiro”

Probably I can make it R Rated:
“Are you her? Cos you made my 🍆 go from zero two hiro” 🤣 lmao I’m dead

Or or or the classic,

“If I were to rate you from 1 to 10, you’re my zero two”
