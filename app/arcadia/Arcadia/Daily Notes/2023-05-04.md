## 🪵 Log
*What's on my mind today?*

1. Now that appDir is stable, how do you suggest devs moving from pages directory to appDir? Is there any specific things we need to lookout for when migrating?
2. Does Vercel Postgres handles scaling/handling the database connections? Or does Neon does that under the hood? For example, if there's sudden surge of open connections at one time.

Did:
1. Worked on the create new site flow, fixed the issue of getting stuck in the loading screen reported by Eric
2. Made good progress on DreamEditor UI scaling, which should make navbar editing experience better.

Will continue on:
1. Make the DreamEditor work with dynamic scale factor.
2. Make a little docs on how these things (elementBox positioning on scaled editor) work.

WebGPU API
AppDir code splits and removes unused JS before sending to client?
