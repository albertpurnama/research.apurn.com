*What's on my mind today?*


We make product that solves people discovery based on any semantic filtering. 

The most interesting to you seems like goal alignment filtering. 

As a sidenote, it’s best to point out that this goal alignment is just one of many filtering that any product of this kind can do. For example: If you want to search for universities to go, you probably want to have a mix of criterias like: who’s the alumnis? what’s the cost/benefit analysis? Is it possible for me to go there. Another example: I want to buy a some christmas gift, filter me the items in amazon (or anywhere) that fits the theme, under $50, unique, and fun gift.

The core of the product is data collection with semantic filtering, everything else - in my opinion - is noise.

It should be obvious, but there’s 2 major things we need: the data and the consumer of the data - it can be people, or binary based systems. The dynamics of the data & consumer of the data can be discussed further because there's some interesting points.

Let's briefly talk about next phase.

This phase happens after we can grow our data organically through the use of the product. In theory, this is network effect (potentially using the wrong term here).

For specifically people discovery, here's the infinite PLG loop that I can think of:
1. Start with VCs, Scrape public data on founders and what they're doing.
2. Gather consumer's data - Gather VCs data, extract most of the information about their existence legally allowed data collection.
3. Sell consumer's data to the next phase's consumer - Sell the VC data to founders & LPs.
4. Gather consumer's data - Gather founder's & LPs data now that they're on the platform
5. Sell consumer's data to the next phase's consumer - Sell LPs data to VC firms, Consulting Firms, PE firms, Financial Data Providers, etc.
6. Continue Gather & Sell over the next phases.
