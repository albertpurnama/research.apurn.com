### 1:1


*PLEASE DEFINE A GOAL FOR RESI*

- Let's pick 1 and stick with it.

After doing UI audit:
1. How many different buttons/forms in the UI?
	1. Take low-hanging fruits, consolidate them into 1 UI package.
	2. If it's not doing documentation, it won't work.
2. To fix the performance: Pick a styling library and we stick with it. vanilla extract.

Get stuck on a bug:

- Managing priorities pretty difficult.

Communication-wise:
- Nothing's off really.

Constant stream of support for a week probably not good.

Wife, kids?

Do you know whether you're doing great in the team or not?
Were you waiting for performance review?

A couple of feedback:
1. I see that you're asking #engineering for CS related question,
2. Asking for reviews on #engineering is good, we should do more of those.
3. Code quality so far I don't really see any problem, seems like you know what you're doing.

English course ever since little.
Mostly it was written.
Meeting up and meeting friends on chat.

Average score isn't enough for IPA
Dulu IPS bukan IPA. So didn't do the mechanical engineer
Went to the Information System path, learn web dev

**On a day-to-day basis, from a scale of 1 to 5: how motivated are you when you're working on your work?**
- 3-4

**Do you have project outside of work?**
- Supplementary tools for the game that he plays
- Astro
- Twitch

Twitch:
- 3-4

Astro:
- very interesting, trying to find the groove on trying new things.
- 5

ESlint/prettier (tooling) fixing:
- 5

Friend of his doing Astro.

**What do you feel about the code you've written so far?**
Alright, can kinda vibe with the code structure so far, see some neat tech being used.
Dumplink going somewhere.
Building blocks of the slate pretty interesting.

DreamEditor stuff probably a gigantic thing that pretty concerning.
Waiting for the docs.

**Given your current status on Twitter, etc. Do you feel like people are look up on you?**
Yes, in Indonesia. Very opinionated person.

**What do you feel about it?**
I don't really care. Post whatever he likes nowadays. Kinda like being a public figure, a responsibility being there.

**How do you feel about people looking up to you?**
Kinda scary, if he can be himself kinda ok.

**Do you feel the same in Typedream?**
Seen that in some part. Typedream is sorta opinionated,
In Dumplink. Kinda yeah, people seems to know him, we all sorta the same. prefers to keep everyone equal.


### February 28, 2023

Goals:
- Maintains at least 1 project.
	- Back in kata.ai: design system.
	- Platform engineering role, frontend tooling, etc.
- Sharing ESLint config.
- Kinda learning turbo on the insides.

NX monorepo:
- Like the concept, one-stop command line to do anything.
- Generally like the idea

Aim to be:
- 65% tooling 
- 35% product

Tooling: 
- ESLint, Prettier?
	- Important to Resi because it's cross-editor auto-fix, prettier can do more than ESLint.

Feedback from Dumpl.ink:
- It's alright, kinda like working on the components.
- Components formatted pretty well.

Need a bit of help on the product cards:
- Need pointers libraries that we want to use
- What is the connection to Typedream products?

So far only Resi & Putri
- Office for socializing
- Bi-weekly basis, on a whim mostly.
- NO Hybrids please.

Communication feedback:
- Kinda good seeing different channels

Notion
- Understandable
- No immediate red flag



### February 21, 2023

- Pretty alright.
- A week or two to get the hang of things.
- Took a bit more on warpin

Trackmania 2 times champion.
video on demand, full match on youtube channel
still kinda play Trackmania for casual competition

You mentioned about documentation, give you docs and you'll learn on your own, what are your thoughts on the existing docs?
- pretty alright
- Things are a bit fragmented, Dumpl.ink different
	- Would be nice to put things together. put things on notion maybe?
	- Basically what are we doing with each of the project and how it's connected.
	- Maybe notion format is good for Resi.

Thoughts on the README.md?
- Useful for running local machine, not really big project architecture

For notion, more format is better:
- Here are how the project are architected.

First page is table of contents.

**Managerial or IC?**
- Technical path (80%)

**Thoughts on the work first week?**
- Something new, blocks and how it fits together. Like building legos for websites.

- Look at the low-hanging fruits and see how connect.
	- The individual components -> low-hanging fruit
	- Connect it to the slate editor

**Don't have any questions?**
Doppler stuff?

**dumpl.ink so far pretty interesting**
- People seems to like the dumpl.ink so far. He showed the project to your friends.
- Like because friends like it, also part of what drives.
- Like because the tech, interesting tech.

**Throws stuff in the wall and see what sticks.**


### Onboarding

**My job is to help you get familiar with the codebase as fast as possible. Any kind of question you can ask anytime. I'll try to reply as soon as possible, or you can directly go to my table and ring me after our daily standup.**


1. What needs to be done?
	1. Setup doppler, vscode, etc.
	2. Project dumplink v2, lead: Putri
2. 1:1 every Monday or Tuesday your pick.
	1. 1:1's purpose: it's a safe space for you to tell me anything you want work-related and by default, I'm going to try to resolve them unless you say otherwise (for example, you just want to rant)
3. Work schedule.
	1. Work schedule 9am-5pm. It's flexible as in you can break it up into, lets say 8am-11am and 6pm-1am. It's preferable to share similar consistent schedule with peers so we can collaborate faster (less waiting on replies to chat).
4. You'll want to know how Typedream work.
	1. Share https://github.com/typedreamhq/cloud#external-documentationlinks
		1. Core things: editor, renderer, dream-editor.
5.
