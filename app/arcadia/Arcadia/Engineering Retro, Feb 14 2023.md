##### Bayu

Improvement:
- Communication


##### Ridho
well:
- Communication with others?
- Sering nongkrong di meja Ibe. Ngobrolin knowledge and bonding

hell:
- Learning curve takes hours to investigate what needs to be done
- Bugs take hours.
- Tickets for new features, ticket is big,
	- pertama di hardcode, terus kadang lupa di fix.

improvement:
- Ticket for new features, break it down into smaller sub issues.
- Happy hours on friday for bonding.



##### Ibe
well:
- Sharing session pretty good
- 1:1 weekly very good.
- Karena boleh nambahin hal hal baru, membantu.

hell:
- Beberapa part in the editor for ex navbar not enough docs.
	- Old editor nested context
- Version history & new navbar. -> cukup besar and challenging
	- 1 week or more to understand what needs to be done

improvement:
- Improve developer experience. 
	- non-transpiled-modules.
	- Storybook
	- Testing smaller functions.
	- ESLint


##### Steven
well:
- Standard design system
- Ngobrol" membantu dari dapetin insights

hell:
- A lot of smaller tasks that cannot be foreseen 
- A lot of smaller part that needs to be checked
- Lack of documentation
- `zustand-query`  problematic.
	- Kalo nambahin/change the type.
- Switching between environment variable.
	- Sometimes testing in staging cannot be tested.

improvement:
- PR review mentions each person
	- PR review sometimes takes time.
- Bug bash, ada orang product dan team design bisa bantu review.
	- Sisanya code review dari code structure & code smell.
- For flow bisa contact ke design team.

*Mungkin gak waktu tasknya dikasih, bakal ada meeting buat penjelasan the tasks?*


##### Putri
well:
- really happy seeing a lot of stuff getting pushed really quickly

hell:
- didn't have enough time to think about every variation of the flow of every project.
	- some mechanism might be missing.

improvement:
- not sure


##### Albert
well:
- Communication works

hell:
- Project estimation.

improvement:



##### Office Hour
- Membantu di awal" project.

##### TODOs
- Happy hour on the weekend
- Earlier planning meeting.
- Reviewing faster:
	- Review the functionality first from preview link, then the code smell.
- Tim product/design yang click", jangan engineer.
	- Functionality perspective engineer sampe OK dulu, baru sampe design.
- Development di mac kena heap alloc.
- Need and want to make docs:
	- Available API doc, Component Doc. What are the components? and how does each of the component work?
	- Lebih ke arah what components are available?
- The session for new parts of the app. how to use it etc.


Review speed:
- 2-3 days. Steve


Functionality vs code smell:
- Testing (testing functionality) dulu.
-
