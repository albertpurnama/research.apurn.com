### Performance Evaluation

Quality of Work

I do think there’s a lot to be improved on - Accuracy, attention to detail, and quality of code.

Recent example:
- Quality of code: isMobile implementation should not be something that I have to point out, you should automatically know that this is a bad practice and fix it. The fact that I need to point this out and teach you the right way is concerning
- Attention to detail: UI details is somewhat ok, I can’t remember the last time you had a problem with this. Implementation details need work (see quality of code)
- Accuracy: So far, all linear/github issue fixes are somewhat accurate to fix that specific ticket, but a lot of the times the fix is only patch, not a core issue fix. See problem solving capabilities.



Problem-solving capabilities and creativity in solutions.
- Need improvements here, I think it is still rare seeing you solve a bug that is a permanent fix rather than patch. It is worth to note that sometimes it is not possible to fix the root cause with allocated time, in this case you have to notify me with a patch solution and the more permanent fix and I’ll help you to change the appetite/points of the github issue

Productivity
- Very good. Keep this up

Ability to meet deadlines and manage time effectively.
- OK


Technical Skills
- Ok, but see problem solving part


Proficiency in relevant programming languages and tools.
- Good. Keep it up!

Adaptability to new technologies and methods.
- not too good, looking at the new xstate implementation that you were tasked to modify, but I hope it will improve over time

Teamwork and Collaboration
- great response time!!

Effectiveness in working with team members.

Communication skills, both within the team and with other departments.
- english needs improvement, especially when talking to users.
- English is definitely something you need to improve if you want to progress. English is required to create great code documentation, interact with users through zendesk, interact with team members.

Initiative and Innovation
- haven’t seen any proposal of improvements from your end, you can learn a thing or two from Ibe about this on how he pitched the idea of xstate to me

Willingness to take on new challenges.
- We did try a few things here, example: CMS on dream-editor. I’d say it didn’t go too well, but I think most of the reason was because you were not familiar with the codebase yet or how things work
