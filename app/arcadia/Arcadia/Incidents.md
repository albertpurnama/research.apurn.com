## Delegation

- Anthony working on Double Side incentive (March 28th)
- Forms & CMS limit to 100 on free plan, takes 2 weeks to complete?


## Cancellation flow

Seems like the button "Manage" is bigger than "Update plan". Maybe we should:
1. Remove this, replace it with change payment method, implement payment method change on our end, or
2. Change the copywriting of "Manage" to something else like, "Change payment method". and make it the same typography as "update plan"
