According to the [quickstart](https://docs.whalesync.com/start-here/quick-start) docs. it seems like the user needs to map the tables on their own (See Step 3 and 4 of the quickstart).

Whalesync doesn't seem to be doing that well in social media, low follower count.

Whalesync seems to not have a lot of connectors, most of them tagged as "Highly Requested", which isn't even implemented yet.
