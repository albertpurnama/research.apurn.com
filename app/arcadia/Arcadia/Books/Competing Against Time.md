"Competing Against Time" by George Stalk Jr. and Thomas M. Hout is a book that focuses on the importance of managing time as a strategic resource in business. Here is a summary of the book along with actionable items:

Summary:

1.  Time is a critical resource that can be leveraged to gain a competitive advantage in business.
    
2.  Companies that are able to optimize their processes and operations to reduce time-related costs and improve efficiency are more likely to succeed.
    
3.  There are four key principles for managing time as a strategic resource: understanding the strategic importance of time, developing a time-based strategy, redesigning processes to minimize wasted time, and implementing a time-based management system.
    
4.  To develop a time-based strategy, companies should focus on reducing the time required to deliver products and services, improving responsiveness to customers, and increasing flexibility in their operations.
    
5.  Redesigning processes to minimize wasted time requires identifying and eliminating bottlenecks, reducing setup times, and streamlining workflows.
    
6.  Implementing a time-based management system involves creating a culture of continuous improvement, setting clear goals and metrics, and empowering employees to take ownership of their work.
    

Actionable items:

1.  Identify time-related costs and inefficiencies in your business processes, and develop strategies to reduce them.
    
2.  Use time as a key metric for measuring performance and improving efficiency.
    
3.  Develop a time-based strategy that focuses on reducing lead times, increasing responsiveness to customers, and improving flexibility in your operations.
    
4.  Redesign your processes to eliminate bottlenecks, reduce setup times, and streamline workflows.
    
5.  Create a culture of continuous improvement and empower employees to take ownership of their work.
    
6.  Set clear goals and metrics for improving time-related performance, and hold employees accountable for meeting these goals.
    
7.  Use technology and automation to streamline processes and reduce time-related costs.

# Action Items

Here are some examples of time-based metrics that can be used to measure performance and efficiency for an engineer:

1.  Cycle time: This metric measures the time it takes to complete a specific process or task, such as developing a new feature or fixing a bug. By tracking cycle time, engineers can identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in their workflows and implement strategies to improve efficiency.
    
2.  Lead time: This metric measures the time it takes to complete a project from start to finish, including ideation, design, development, testing, and deployment. By tracking lead time, engineers can identify areas where the development process can be streamlined and optimized to deliver projects faster.
    
3.  Time-to-market: This metric measures the time it takes to deliver a new product or feature to market. By reducing time-to-market, engineers can ensure that their company remains competitive in a fast-paced market and is able to deliver products and features before their competitors.
    
4.  Downtime: This metric measures the amount of time that systems or applications are unavailable due to downtime or system failures. By minimizing downtime, engineers can ensure that their systems are reliable and available to users, improving overall user experience and reducing support costs.
    
5.  Response time: This metric measures the time it takes for a system or application to respond to user requests. By minimizing response time, engineers can improve overall user experience and ensure that their systems are able to handle high volumes of traffic.
    
6.  Maintenance time: This metric measures the time spent on maintenance tasks, such as updating software or performing system upgrades. By reducing maintenance time, engineers can focus on developing new features and improving system performance, rather than spending time on routine maintenance tasks.
    

By tracking these time-based metrics, engineers can identify areas for improvement and implement strategies to optimize their workflows and improve overall performance and efficiency.
