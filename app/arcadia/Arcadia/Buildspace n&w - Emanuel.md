I'm Albert, I'm a cofounder of Typedream, all in one tool for creators to create and sell online.

Today, I have a mission:
1. I want to get as much feedback as possible on our newest product and our onboarding process

Can I have 5 minutes of your time? I promise to be as quick as possible.

Grab:
- Social media URLs (2 of them)
- A profile pic
- Email account ready for login

Ok so our mission is we want to get you a Typedream link in bio as fast as possible.

After going through onboarding: 

1. Try to personalize the page:
	1. Change your name.
	2. Update profile picture
	3. Add 2 of your social media links
2. Add CTA to the thing you're working on rn
