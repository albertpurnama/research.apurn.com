Today: April 3rd 2023

Seems like there are 2 problems:
1. Estimation, we can't estimate properly, therefore we're missing our deadlines
2. Speed, maybe the engineers' aren't fast enough

## estimation

Observations:
1. Ibe-navbar, we had to do navbar toolbar, and it seems like there's more fuckery going on that it needs to be pushed back a bit more
2. Bayu- doing well estimation wise after fixing communication (from cycle 1 retro)

I tried figuring out a better [[Product Engineering Cycle]] for fixing estimation. After putri's discussion:
1. Spend a couple days in the beginning making sure that the engineers know what to do as detailed as possible. This should ensure there's no surprises during the cycle
2. Make sure there's a documentation on:
	1. Product specification (use cases, user stories?)
	2. Links to code section for each use cases of the product.

## speed

Engineers should be better & faster with time. How do we measure speed? How can we measure it objectively?
