Hi Miloš,

It's great connecting with you. I’m Albert, cofounder of Typedream (acq), YC W20 batch.

I was doing website builder before but looking to learn unity for game development. I already got some of the basics nailed down, but looking to learn more about character interaction through raycasts and colliders

But having issues with a mix of animation and user interaction

Are you open for consulting/mentoring work?
