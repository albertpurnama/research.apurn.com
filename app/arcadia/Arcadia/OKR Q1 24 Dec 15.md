# Q4 Learnings

Product:
- If it's old problem, no solution, then we make solution then it might work?
- New problem -> can make a bet, it might work too
- Old problem, with existing solution, don't need to work.

The Market:
- The market depends on the hype
	- Notion creators -> when notion hype is gone, the market is gone too.
		- Notion creator bet is too small?
- Hopefully, the market has been there for a long time or going to stay for a long time.
- A lot of people don't want to change, so we need to build products around their current workflow/habit
- Impossible to win the market if we're not early.
- Easy to market around hype-y features/products.

**core product needs to not hype based, the features built on top of the core product can be hype-y**

Engineering:
- Comms -> main driver in success? 
	- 1 project divided by 2 people makes sure:
		- People are on the same page
		- Prioritization is better
		- Find better ways to do things
