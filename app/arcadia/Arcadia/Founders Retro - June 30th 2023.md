Last quarter:
- Suggestion: Work together same place, same time? Work schedule improvement
	- Putri: 
		- Need her own space, flow state.
		- 
	- Michelle: effort distribution is not equal, not same place, same time. With OKR, task distribution is not equal to reach the OKR.
- 

Findings:
- Churn (As of April 4th):
	- Expensive
	- There are alternatives

Cycle 4.5.6:
- Ridho kayaknya kebanyakan.

Tracking for each project:
1. Need to have a list of mixpanel events to be implemented
2. Then, ask the project lead for estimation on when (1) will start to be tracked.

Suggestions

## Putri
What went well
- Quite on track on the OKR, specifically for dumpl.ink v2 and Typedream
	- Typedream workspace
- Cycle 3 tasks is a bit more aligned, not all over the place.

What went hell
- Hard time PM-ing the thing, orchestrating the project management.
	- Onboarding flow mau ditambahin link in bio.
	- There are flows that sort of complicated, need to fix it.
- Product quality on CS and QA, cannot do this, too many things.
	- For now, maybe can only ask periodically whether there's any urgent quality issue that needs to be addressed.
- Haven't seen the marketing plan.
	- mixpanel (tracking)
	- public template (workspace)
	- double sided incentive (rewardful)
		- Supposed to increase revenue, but there should be a frontend side.
	- stripe data export (churn)

Suggestions
- None yet

# Comments
- Kevin
	- We need to have a company objective & every person's objective is aligned with the company's objective
	- Need to learn how to reignite the fire (by trying fun stuff like AI maybe although it's not related to the company?)
- Putri
	- The conclusion of the data processing is still wrong
	- Turnover between changing the old marketing efforts (podcast, user success story) to the new marketing efforts is a bit slow
- Anthony
- Albert
	- Need someone to handle Finance that's not us (pay consultants) so the time & effort can be used for other things like do marketing-engineering stuff (AI), agency, etc.
- Michelle
	- Same with Kevin: We need to have a company objective & every person's objective is aligned with the company's objective
	- Same with Albert: Need someone to handle Finance that's not us (pay consultants) so the time & effort can be used for other things like do marketing-engineering stuff (AI), agency, etc. (but this is essentially the same as point 1 because "optimizing finance" does not align with the company's objective - the objective is just to make finance in maintenance mode)
