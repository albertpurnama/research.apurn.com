As you might have known, the past few days has been a really ugly battlefield between DreamEditor and customer support.

Some critical bugs slipped away, causing mayhem and lost of sleep for some of us

But we gather here today, not to talk about the shenanigans that happens a couple of days ago. I gathered us here today to talk about what I learned in the past couple of days.

Some of you are worried, thinking that this is your fault. Some of you are afraid, thinking that you might get fired. Some of you are tired, thinking the never ending work that’s coming up ahead.

I would be lying if I said I was fine the past couple of days. But I believe that in this dark moment, something great can begin.

If there’s any learning that I can get from the past few days, it’s this:
- No person can get through hard times like this without a team, be it their families, coworkers, high school friends, that drunk person that you met on a bar that you tell all your shit to them.

For more than 3 months, we put our heads down, think, and build. We laugh, some of us feel depressed, some of us pulled all nighter.

In the past couple of days, I was only able to:
- Fix 8 bugs, with the help of Putri
- Answer a couple of support tickets, with the help of Michelle

You matter.
- We reported over 200 bugs and resolved over the past 2 months or so.
- We merged Over 100 PRs to make DreamEditor a reality
- We reduced QA test time by 50%
- We did this all while shipping and maintaining other features.
