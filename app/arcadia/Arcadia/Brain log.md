July 14 midnight, I went to the Murphy’s nightclub, didn’t go in though. just taking a look from the outside. What I learned was I need to have a script for talking to girls or people in general, before I can think on the fly.

I’m thinking maybe the script starts with a complement and then goes wherever the conversation sort of go.

Or maybe we define a goal first like what do you want the conversation to be about the general topic of the conversation and then you start with complement, and then use you ease into the topic that you want you some of figure out a way to convert the initial conversation about the compliment into the conversation about the topic that you picked in the first place.
