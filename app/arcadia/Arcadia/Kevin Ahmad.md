- Perlu pixel perfect gak?
	- Gak

When debugging:
- Take a look at the broken component, then figure out what went wrong

Documentation right now:
- Only good to know, doesn't solve the actual problem.
	- For debugging: not really useful.
- Form implementation:
	- Diagram of the connection between the data types, and how it is used on the editor and saved in the backend.

- Codebase is huuuuge.

	- Feel slow because:
		- Investigation is pretty slow, not familiar with the codebase.
		- 
	- If you can, can you assign different areas.
	- Anything we can do to help expedite?
		-
