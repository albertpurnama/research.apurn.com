Hi all, I'm based in Sunnyvale at the moment. I have a love/hate relationship with software development in general but I think I won't stop even after retirement. If I'm not working I spend time trying to get better at volleyball, rocket league, or Fifa. I'm looking forward to building cool stuff with you all!
