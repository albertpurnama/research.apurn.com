Hey guys, 

I've been spending some time reading about OKR (Objective, Key Results). This method has been implemented by many large companies (Google) as well as smaller scale companies (Alpaca). It has been widely accepted as a way to set goals and align teams across departments.

Some reasons why I think OKR makes sense for our case:
1. OKRs are simple, it's not a 2+ hour meeting like we usually do. It's tied to both individual + company wide objective, which results in the ability for each individual to manage their own workload without top down management.
2. OKRs are known to be a great tool for enabling individual team member to be independent. Independence means that managers will no longer need to (as frequently) answer the question "What should my direct reports do this week?"
3. OKRs are agile, it can be re-configured whenever it makes sense.
4. OKRs give a sense of ownership and purpose to the work.
5. We are still at the early stage of the company, company's working culture need to be set to a certain standard.

The process of adopting OKR is one that is more of a journey than a step by step guide. It needs frequent tweaks based on what works and what does not. A LOT of adjustments will be made to how we define Objectives and measure Key Results.

There are 3 core principles that should never be altered for OKRs to work:
1. Objectives need to be singular, specific goal.
2. Key results have to be measurable.
3. OKRs are public, anyone in the company sees everyone's OKRs.

I think we should start doing this, starting with us founders. If you don't agree, please drop your reasoning + thoughts below 👇



I've also been thinking about reasons why OKRs won't work:
1. Metrics are really hard to be tied to actual objectives that matters (revenue increase). -> I agree, but does that mean we don't track anything? I don't think so. 
2. Need to implement a lot of metrics to be accurate, graph, etc to know whether we do something that actually works. This takes a lot of effort and we probably don't need this early on. -> You can do time based metric and use common sense to create key results that have high possibility to reach the objective.
