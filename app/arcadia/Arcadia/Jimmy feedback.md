Hi Jimmy,

I hope you're doing well! Thanks again for taking the time to chat with us about the potential M&A of Typedream. We really appreciated the opportunity to connect with you and your team.

I understand you decided to pass on the acquisition, and I respect that decision. However, I'd love to get some feedback from you if possible. It would be super helpful for us as we continue to improve and grow.

Could you share any thoughts on:

1. What you liked and didn't like about our product and team?
2. Any specific concerns or reasons for passing on the acquisition?
3. Any suggestions for how we could improve?

Your insights would mean a lot to us. We're always looking to get better, and your feedback would be invaluable.

Thanks again for your time and consideration. Looking forward to staying in touch and hopefully working together in some way down the road.

Best,  
Albert
CTO @Typedream
