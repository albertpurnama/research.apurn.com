**What went well**
- The whole thing talking like a friend.
- Work also like together with a friend
- Provided space to talk about rants
- Appreciate big feature works even new (Toolbar, Rapihin ESLint).

**What went HELL**
- Give feedback more frequent case by case, not only the perf review.
	- For example: answering Slack, should be earlier notice.
- Re: Performance Review, provide space, 360 review might be good.
	- Performance review one sided, employer to employee.
	- 360:
		- Feedback from Peer
		- Feedback from Manager
		- Self assessment.
		- Calibration:
			- Only manager.
- More non-work relationship.
- Requirement definition is not good for her:
	- Acceptance Criteria
	- Corner cases that we should look at
	- General context
**BANTUIN ARMEDI JAWAB SLACK**


### For the company in general
- Feels like direction changes all the time.
	- Focus web3, then focus PH, then mobile.
	- Because of this, feels like the work that she has done not really contribute to those purposes.
- Tests!


### Additional ranting
- Eric provide design, only happy path, no corner case. corner case: "If there's many stuff how?"
