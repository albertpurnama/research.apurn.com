- Understanding Plate is difficult. A session to understand Plate might be good early on.
- Intro to the Codebase's structure
- Data flow
	- What data is stored in Editor-store?
	- Toolbar takes data from where?
- Maybe `renderer` is better for the introduction.


DO NOT USE anything other than Plate Core!
