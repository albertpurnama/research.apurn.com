>In order to choose the knowledge management tool, consider the pieces of knowledge you want to organize. Is it a collection of notes and documents? Is it resources and benefits for your employees? What about steps in a process a specific team should follow?

Collection of notes, explanation of how things work and how to use some of the components that is available.

System for collecting notes/documents:
1. Draft
2. Peer Review
3. Finalize

System for updating notes:
1. Update outdated docs immediately

System for replacing notes:
- Same as system for collecting notes/documents
- Deprecate old notes (don't delete, for context)

Rules:
- Code references need to be perma-link, with optional screenshot


-------
**Problems:**
- Cannot find what components exists
	- Storybook
- Doesn't know how `dream-editor` works.
	- Notion docs? complete with examples?


**Use perma-links for code references**

**Todos:**
- [ ] Create a poll on the stuff that needs more docs.
- [ ] Update https://www.notion.so/typedreamhq/Typedream-Engineering-a609f25d754a49f595342c7df4739304 based on the poll.
