- We have different cycles for each OKR, mine is per cycle, but for Michelle I think some KR are set to "by the end of Q2". Is this ok? how do we record this or what will the dashboard sort of look like?
	- Quarterly objective/KR
	- Monthly checkin
	- Weekly update
- There are some KRs that might not be measureable as of now:
	- 40% of users saying they will be very disappointed -> don't we need some survey implemented in the editor?
- Why do we have > 1 objectives per person? Are we not on the same page on what OKR is and what its purpose is?
	- Michelle
		- What is ambassadors? like Easlo right?
		- Do we need a more measureable term of "Active Discord Community"? How Active is Active?
	- Kevin
		- What does increasing revenue mean? MoM revenue growth?
		- Isn't LTV increase sort of corelated to decreasing churn, if you decrease churn, ltv should also go up (I know there's other things like playing with pricing), should we combine the 2 into 1? Just so it's easier for me to process
	- Anthony
		- Why do we think we need Infra + Backend OKR? isn't it part of my OKR which is reducing the # of critical bugs reported by user as close to 0?
- Where should we consolidate this?
	- Notion? Google Sheets?
