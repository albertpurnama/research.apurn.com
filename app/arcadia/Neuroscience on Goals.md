**Peripersonal Space vs Extrapersonal Space**
- Need to focus on the goal line or one point ( focus on extrapersonal space)
**Imagine older self for longer term goal**
**Visualization of goal need to be done correctly.**
- Maintaining pursuit is going to be hard if you visualize the end goal or reward.
**Visualize failure to maintain long ongoing motivator. FORESHADOW FAILURE!**
**Make Goals moderately lofty**
**Not too many goals a year** 
**Specificity of a goal, Weekly assessment**
