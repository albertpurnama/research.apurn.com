I'm going to create an Answer Engine Analytics platform that will mainly take a couple of keywords and call every major AI providers that has web search capabilities to see how the brand perform.

here are 3 **visibility-focused** metrics businesses will care about:
1. **Answer Presence Rate**
    _Definition:_ % of queries where the brand/product is mentioned at all.
    _Use:_ Measures overall brand visibility across answer engines.
    
2. **Answer Positioning Score**
    _Definition:_ How early and prominently the brand/product appears in responses (e.g., mentioned in the first 1–2 sentences vs buried).
    _Use:_ Indicates top-of-mind status or influence.
    
3. **Cross-Engine Coverage**
    _Definition:_ % of answer engines (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) that return a result mentioning the brand for a given query set.
    _Use:_ Reveals breadth of visibility across platforms.
