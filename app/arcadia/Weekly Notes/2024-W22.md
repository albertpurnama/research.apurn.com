*What's on my mind this week?*

Question:
1. How is it fair that we buy them out at beehiiv’s valuation? 
2. 


Either:
1. Go through with the acq (Beehiiv)
	1. MKA don't want, it's risky because golden handcuff, killing startup dream
2. MKA offers to buy PA out.
	1. PA ask how much?
		1. How much do you think is fair?
			1. Beehiiv's value seems fair (400k/person, 800k total). OK deal
			2. PA wants 600k (1.2M). How about you buy us out (3)
3. PA buy MKA out
	1. 600k per person.
		1. PA don't want, why? you just offered yourself that. How much do you want to buy us out? go to (2)
	2. Offers low, then MKA counter: "How about we buy you out at that?"
	3. Offer's fair: 400k, OK deal.
	4. Offer's suboptimal (300k), still deal, because an raise again.

Consideration for Beehiiv's all cash:
$3M cash


~~How do we divide this between 5 of us? This should also incentivize people who stay @beehiiv. People who stay at beehiiv will do the phase 1, phase 2, phase 3 integration which is separate from the sale of the product itself, by definition, the people who stay at beehiiv stay & work & make this deal possible, why are they not awarded for it?~~

Why do we want to stay longer at Beehiiv?
- Want to not piss off the acquirer.
- Can actually still do the startup (??) probably not.
- There's no incentives for the people who stay to work faster.
