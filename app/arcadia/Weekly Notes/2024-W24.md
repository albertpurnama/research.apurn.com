Delaware C-Corp
Did we file Charter? Did it include bylaws vesting schedule. 
- 83b form at IRS 
- Ask tax attorney, Ask YC.
- State level:
	- Typedream to C-Corp
- IRS:
	- Elect as S-Corp classification, passthrough, no corporate level taxes, distribution tax. won't pay self employment tax. <- this gets rid of double taxation. (can backdate 1 year, say file in January 1st 2024)
- Setup parent company in nevada, go through sale.

The most tax savings:
- corporate: QSBS stock purchase.
- pesonal: Carbon tax credits. passthrough through Scorp.

Meeting with Aaron Hsu

- A bit of context 
- Want to hear a little bit about your story
- A bit of questions (tax, deep tech, etc)

- We do have MnA offer:
	- Asset purchase (not stock purchase) structure:
		- 50% cash up front
		- 50% cash tied to milestones
	- Thinking of starting a next one soon after milestones are completed (within the year.)
		- Other than setting up for QSBS, anything else?
		- Place of residence sucks. <- Cali will tax you if you build your company here. it's already too late for Typedream, but for the next one, any suggestions?



Core questions:
1. Should I hire tax consultant for these? Any tips on how to look for one? Maybe also ballpark estimate on cost?
	1. In California, unique.
	2. Ask to prepare for a plan.


- How's Actual.VC? What area of deep tech do you guys usually invest in?
	- Advanced materials, energy, life science.
		- Most are PhD. True deep tech, usually means PhD.
		- New battery development. Carbon capture
		- VC moving away from software & hardware.
- Trusts & Estate a couple of millions of
	- Setting up trust
	- Trust is considered as a separate person.
	- Anything less than 2 mill wouldn't be worth it.
- I'm looking for a bigger problem to solve next, what's interesting that VC's are looking into?
