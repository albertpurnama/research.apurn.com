# Perf Review

## Feedback for me!

### Negative / Can be improved
- Clarity. Related to company-wide.
	- Pernah nanya: Career Growth in Typedream. Waktu itu belom tau kemana. Sisi positifnya: ada **honesty**.
	- Terlalu **honest** ada hal gak baiknya, dari sisi employee kadang perlu lebih jelas, nggak samar" kayak gitu. **Ketidakpastian** bikin kurang nyaman.
- Aligning engineering interest with founder's interest. New editor initiative is good. README repository cloud the word **utopia**.
	- Dari sisi founder: tujuan founder ningkatin revenue, spaghetti code gapapa.
	- Dari sisi employee: company growth biasa gak ber-efek banyak buat mereka. Mereka perlu code bagus di awal, biar mereka bisa belajar. 
	- Maksudnya, gimana caranya kita align ini?
		- Ada beberapa hal yang spaghetti code dulu, dari sudut pandang engineer, agak merasa kurang enak.

### Positive
- Keterbukaan as a founder, feels like there's no hierarchy, see him as equal.
- Honesty, there's no hidden stuff behind, tapi kadang keterbukaan bikin ga enak.
- Nggak malu untuk nanya, can learn from him too, never from other workplaces, di beberapa tempat gap malah berasa jauh.
- Ethos kerja very good! Semangat kerja nya bagus banget, dari awal udah bagus.
- Dari depan gak keliatan ada konflik.

**Things to do**
- Bukti potong pajak.

Self-review:

### From me
- Let's keep doing what we're doing.
- I have no visibility towards the things that you did that I didn't review or even the chats that you answer in slack.
	- This may affect this feedback meeting to be less efficient.
	- I don't know whether that's a good thing or not, what do you think?
- I do realize that there are fewer mentions from you to me in crisp chat or support chat in general, you either directly pipe it into the engineering channel or you resolve it, which both of them are good I think.
- Right now, I'm not planning to add more engineering members in the foreseeable future, is this concerning to you in any way?

Self-review:
To be improved:
- Lack of communication with the rest of the team.
		- Steven only 1 time
		- Eric not yet.
		- Bella & monica, not yet too.
	- Why do you think it's important for communication:
		- Small team, only 10, need bonding.
	- What's preventing communication?
		- Remote work is the main cause.
		- Because Armedi is introvert
	- How we can help to alleviate this problem?
		- IDK
	- When michelle, kevin go back, it's very nice.
		- after meeting physically, it makes all chat more comfy for him

The good:
- Independent problem solver.
	- Find solutions, alternatives, which one is good, etc.
- The solution is understandable or no?
	- He's trying to make the solution more understandable.
	- Make PR description better.
- Work hours: very good

### From me
The good
1. The talk about salary raise last time is very good because it eliminates any doubts and it builds trust (hopefully).
2. Work-wise very good.
	1. Answering slack is good enough.
	2. I think the dev on the editor is still a bit on the slow side, but understandable since there are a lot of things to figure out and I'm not helping lmao
	3. I really like your coding style & practices, I think we should keep it up. Although I have 1 concern on this (later on). But generally please keep it up
3. 

The concerns:
1. Typescript typing
	1. It takes a while for me to read out what exactly the types in `zustand-query` does, it makes sense after a couple of reads, but I think we shouldn't do a lot of those, I just want to make sure this is clear.
	2. It's better to have copied over definition than having complex definition

The questions
1. Development of `zustand-query`, what's up with that
	1. *Documentation is pretty gg*
	2. *React-query to TAN-stack query?*
		1. Framework agnostic
		2. zustand-query is too simple to be open-sourced.
			1. our approach is too simple.
2. Why don't you do open source thing anymore?
	1. Lexical:
		1. Cannot be implemented in block based editor.
		2. Nested editor
	2. Too busy experimenting with editor, no time to experiment with anything else.
4. Is there anything NOT in the "good section" that you feel like you've been working on and I didn't recognize?
	1. N/A, 
5. Are you comfortable with existing company culture? (game nights, social stuff even though almost non-existent).
	1. *Language barrier is making things difficult.
		1. *Escape room fun. But, language barrier.
		2. *Since he hasn't met anyone, he cannot really bond if you have never met the person.
	2. What would you like to add?
		1. Company outing
		2. How does he try to get more involved?
	3. Does not feel like he's left out.

### December 18th 2022
- Bingung mau kerjain apa
- Radix cannot be used here



### December 11th 2022
Banyak yang nanya ke Armedi. Tapi yang ditangkep dari Armedi:
- Selalu nanya gaji, banyak banyangin ini gaji US. Bikin orang excited dari awal, akan ikut interview.

### sometime ago.
- Culture related: there's thanksgiving, halloween, etc.
	- Too US-centric. Indo-people won't get it or relate.
		- Mughaz bikin kopi susu.

1. Standup maybe do text based. Linear divide per person.
2. Crisp chat quite bad, cos chronological order, sometimes missed.
3. For debugging:
	1. Completely duplicate sites. Admin dashboard maybe.
