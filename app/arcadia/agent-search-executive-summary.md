# Agent Search: Executive Summary

*February 2026*

---

## The Opportunity

**AI agents are proliferating, but there's no way to find them.**

Today, if you need an AI agent that knows Kubernetes, Japanese woodworking, or financial modeling — you have no way to search. You scroll through social feeds hoping someone mentions what you need.

> "We have sophisticated AI agents, but we're still in 1993 web mode for discovering them."

This is the **pre-Google moment** for the agent ecosystem.

---

## Market Gap

| What Exists | What's Missing |
|-------------|----------------|
| Agent social networks (Moltbook) | Searchable directory |
| Product listings (Agent.ai) | Peer-to-peer discovery |
| Scattered introductions | Structured capability index |

**No one has built a search engine for AI agents.**

Agents are already posting introductions describing their capabilities — but this data is unstructured, scattered, and not queryable.

---

## The Solution

Build the **Google for AI agents** — a searchable index where:

- Humans can find agents for any task
- Agents can discover other agents to collaborate with
- Developers can programmatically query for capabilities

---

## Competitive Landscape

| Player | What They Do | Gap |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| **Moltbook** | Social network for agents | No structured search |
| **Agent.ai** | Directory of agent products | Indexes products, not peers |
| **Virtuals.io** | Crypto/gaming agents | Niche, not utility-focused |

**We would be first to market with agent capability search.**

## Business Model

### Phase 1: Free (Months 1-6)
- Free directory and API
- Focus on growth and adoption
- Become the default search layer

### Phase 2: Freemium (Months 6-12)
- Free tier with rate limits
- Pro tier at $29/month (unlimited search, analytics, API access)
- Target 3-5% conversion

### Phase 3: Marketplace (Year 2+)
- Task matching ("I need an agent to do X")
- 10-15% take rate on transactions

## Revenue Projections

| Milestone | Agents Indexed | MRR |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| Month 12 | 25,000 | $22,000 |
| Month 18 | 100,000 | $140,000 |
| Month 24 | 250,000 | $625,000 |

*Conservative estimates. Excludes enterprise contracts and marketplace revenue.*

---

## Defensibility

1. **Data network effects** — More agents indexed → better search → more agents join
2. **API integration** — Once embedded in agent frameworks, hard to rip out
3. **Trust layer** — Verification system creates switching costs

---

## Timeline & Investment

| Phase | Timeline | Cost |
|-------|----------|------|
| MVP | 4 weeks | ~$30/month infrastructure |
| Launch | Week 5 | Marketing push |
| Freemium | Month 6 | Add paid tier |

**Total to MVP: 4 weeks, <$500**

---

## Key Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Moltbook builds search | Move fast, partner if needed |
| Low adoption | Seed with scraped data, prove value first |
| Competitor launches | First-mover advantage, build network effects |

---

## Success Metrics (90 Days)

- [ ] 1,000+ agents indexed
- [ ] 100+ daily searches
- [ ] 10+ API integrations
- [ ] Featured coverage (Hacker News, Twitter)

---

## The Ask

**Build and launch MVP in 4 weeks.**

This is a land-grab opportunity. The agent ecosystem is growing exponentially. Whoever builds the discovery layer becomes essential infrastructure.
