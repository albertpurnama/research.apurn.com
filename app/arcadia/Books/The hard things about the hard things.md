1.  Build a strong culture: Your company culture will be one of the most important factors in your success. It's essential to set clear values and expectations from the beginning, and to hire people who share those values.

3.  Hire the right people: Your team is crucial to your success. Focus on hiring people with the right skills, attitude, and cultural fit, and be willing to let go of those who aren't a good fit.
4.  Embrace the struggle: Running a startup is hard, and you will face many challenges along the way. Embrace the struggle and learn from your failures, as they will make you a better leader.
5.  Make tough decisions quickly: As a leader, you will often have to make tough decisions with limited information. Learn to make decisions quickly and confidently, even when the outcome is uncertain.
6.  Manage your emotions: Leading a company can be emotionally draining, so it's important to find ways to manage your stress and stay focused on your goals.
7.  Focus on the long-term vision: It's easy to get caught up in short-term wins, but it's essential to keep your eye on the long-term vision for your company. Stay focused on your goals and keep pushing forward, even when the going gets tough.


## Manage your emotions

1.  Find a way to release your emotions: As a leader, it's normal to feel stressed and anxious at times. Horowitz suggests finding a way to release those emotions, such as through exercise, talking to a friend or mentor, or writing in a journal.
2.  Seek support: Don't try to go it alone. Seek support from your team, your board, or other entrepreneurs who have been through similar experiences. Having a support network can help you stay focused and maintain perspective.
3.  Stay positive: It's easy to get bogged down by negativity, but Horowitz advises staying positive and looking for opportunities in every situation. Focusing on the positive can help you maintain momentum and keep your team motivated.
4.  Focus on the long-term: When you're dealing with a crisis, it can be tempting to focus on the short-term and try to solve immediate problems. However, Horowitz emphasizes the importance of keeping the long-term vision in mind and making decisions that will benefit the company in the long run.
5.  Practice self-awareness: Being self-aware can help you manage your emotions and make better decisions. Horowitz suggests taking time to reflect on your emotions and how they're affecting your behavior. You can also seek feedback from others to help you better understand your own strengths and weaknesses.
