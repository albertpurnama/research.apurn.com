> Is there anything else that I'm missing?

**Expectations or Goals Previous Goals:**
- Answer Slack -> I see some improvements.
- Less management requirement -> I can see some improvement.
- Maintaining speed of work -> on bugs: good, on features: need improvement (but I think it's expected because the requirements is often times not clear.)

**Accomplishments**
- Number of projects, PR
- Business impact (?)

**What Typedream needs:**
- Problem solvers, not executors. 

**Things to improve:**
- Need to be more careful when testing, missed a couple of edge cases.
- Need to problem solve (more think of a solution instead of asking what you should do, then propose solution)

I have a disappointing proposal for you. at the end of this call you're going to think that I'm a manager that's incompetent, petty, unable to budget well. But still, I think as a manager it is my job to tell you the best offer that I have right now.

1. I'm going to do a performance review more frequently, so instead of every 6 months, let's do every 6 weeks (1.5 months).
2. I'll try to get other perks like the justjavascript reimbursement your way to improve your overall performance and code quality.
3. There's no salary raise
4. 


**No raise, next performance review mid Sept 2022.**

Just a very brief recap on what you should focus on for the next performance review:
1. Forget work speed (code implementation) for feature specific work. Do it at your own pace for now, we can always find ways to ramp up the speed later.
2. Focus on problem solving. Things you should be doing on this:
	1. Propose solution before asking for one.
	2. Ask for feedback/comments for the solution you proposed.
	3. Ask for clarification on the feedback that you proposed.
