Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today, Jay. I’m excited to be here!

**Brief Personal Background:**
I’m currently the CTO of Typedream. I have a background in *computer science from UC San Diego* and went in *YC W20 batch*, which has provided me with a solid foundation in *building software systems*.

**Professional Background:**
Over the past 9 years *together with my other 4 cofounders*, I’ve had the opportunity to work on *various projects* that have honed my skills in *software development*, from *financial systems* all the way up to *website editors*.

**Current Focus and Goals:**
Currently, I’m focused on *building AI applications*. For example, I’m working on *Typedream's AI website builder*, which aims to *simplify/automate website building process for web designers*. This aligns well with *Figma's vision on making design accessible to all*, but we're starting small by focusing on web designers.

**Conclusion and Engagement:**
I’m really looking forward to our conversation today and to exploring how we can work together. I’m happy to answer any questions you might have and to discuss any topics you’re interested in.

Hi Jay,

I hope you’re doing well!

Thanks for connecting with me on LinkedIn. I’m really inspired by your experience and all the amazing things you’ve done in the engineering/AI world. I’d love to get your thoughts on a couple of questions I have:

	1.	If you were 27 again today, what would you be working on?
	2.	You’ve worked with a lot of engineers in your career. Have you met those legendary 10x or mythical 100x engineers? What makes them stand out and perform at such a high level?

I’d really appreciate any insights you can share. Thanks a lot for your time!
